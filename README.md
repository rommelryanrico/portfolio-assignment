## Target Audience
My target audience is potential employers looking to hire a junior developer or fellow developers wanting to collaborate on a new project.

## Tech Stack
Only HTML and CSS was used to create the website. The website was deployed using the hosting service Netlify.

## Design Process
 I found four websites from the internet of other developers portfolios that gave me inspiration for my own design. I also made slight changes while creating my site to fit with a theme that was not thought of until after the design was originally approved. I decided to stick with an astronaut space man vibe after deciding to make my avatar have a space suit. This was because I wanted my avatar to wear something cool and that then lead to me wanting to animate a spaceship across my site.

 While making my website, I was checking my work on firefox but did not realise some of the animations were incompatible on other browsers until I tested it. I spent half a day adding code to my css files to make my animations work on other browsers.

## Project Plan & Timeline
One day (Tue) was spent designing the layout and design of the website.

Wednesday to Friday I was able to finish the html and structure of my site and some css animations.

Saturday to Sunday were spent fine tuning css animations (mainly spaceship) and changing slight details to content.

## Short Answer Q&A

1. Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words).

    1969 
    First message was sent from one computer to another over the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). 

    1971
    Ray Tomlinson developed the first system to send mail back and forth (email) between users of ARPANET.

    Vinton Cerf invented a way to introduce computers across the globe to each other in a virtual space, this invention was called Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),which was followed by Internet protocol (IP). 

    1980 
    Scientists used Cerf’s Protocol to send data back and forth. 

    1991 
    Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. This was an entire network of information that was accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. 

    1992

    Mosaic was created and it would popularize surfing the web. 

    1994
    AOL and CompuServe start providing dial-up Internet access. A way to connect to the Internet via telephone line. 

2.	Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words).

    DNS

    It is made up of thousands of computers referred to as servers, which host websites. Each computer is assigned their own address (IP), in a form of strings or numbers. To make it easier for humans, we created domain names. 

    Domains

    Your domain name is connected to the specific IP address of your website, it serves as the online address of your website.

    Web Servers

    Software or hardware that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. Can contain one or more websites. Processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols. The function is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients. 

    Web Browsers

    An application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. Each individual web page, image, and video is identified by a (URL). It enables browsers to retrieve these resources from a web server and display them on the user's device.

3.	Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words).

    The Internet has changed how retail stores do business and people shop in a massive way.

    Websites like Amazon, eBay and Alibaba allow people to make purchases from the comfort of their home instead of having to leave the house to purchase goods and services.

    These purchases will be delivered straight to the customer’s address and in certain countries can be delivered on the same day.

    This has increased the profit margin of certain companies and also increased the amount of shopping that people will do just because of the ease of online shopping on the internet.
